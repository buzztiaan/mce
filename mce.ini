#            1 show pattern even when the display is on
#            2 only show pattern when the display is off, including acting dead
#            3 show pattern even when the display is on, including acting dead

# LED(s) to map to Engine 1/Engine 2
#         "r", "g", "b" maps the LED to engine 1
#         "R", "G", "B" maps the LED to engine 2
#         Example:
#            "rG" maps the red LED to engine 1,
#                      the green LED to engine 2,
#		       and leaves the blue LED unmapped
#         Avoid mapping the same LEDs to both engines...
# Engine 1 pattern in Lysti format (16 commands at most)
# Engine 2 pattern in Lysti format (16 commands at most)
#
# 0000 -- Jump to the start of the pattern for the channel
# 40xx -- Set channel brightness
# 9d80 -- Refresh Mux (use as first command in every pattern!)
# xxyy -- Increment/decrement
#      xx determines the speed;
#         02-3f -- short step time (granularity 0.49ms)
#         42-7f -- long step time (granularity 15.6ms)
#
#	  If xx is even, increment
#         If xx is odd, decrement
#      yy determines the increment/decrement steps
#         00-ff -- in/decrement steps
#
#         Use 0 steps to create pauses
#         Two consecutive increment/decrement sequences are needed
